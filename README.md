# Receiver 2 Mods

To install, download any single dll file and put it in `Receiver 2\Receiver2_Data\Managed` wherever the game is installed.  
  If you're not familiar with GitHub, here are some more specific instructions on downloading:  
  1) Click on the folder name of the mod you want to download  
  2) Click on the title of the dll, Wolfire.Receiver2.dll  
  3) On the right side of the screen, look for the button that says "download"  

To uninstall, replace the Wolfire.Receiver2.dll file with the original or run Steam's verify game files tool.
